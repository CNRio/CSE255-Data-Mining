# # Part 1: Parse JSON strings to JSON objects

# Python has built-in support for JSON.
# 
# **UPDATE:** Python built-in json library is too slow. In our experiment, 70% of the total running time is spent on parsing tweets. Therefore we recommend using [ujson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ujson) instead of json. It is at least 15x faster than the built-in json library according to our tests.

# ## Broken tweets and irrelevant messages
# 
# The data of this assignment may contain broken tweets (invalid JSON strings). So make sure that your code is robust for such cases.
# 
# In addition, some lines in the input file might not be tweets, but messages that the Twitter server sent to the developer (such as [limit notices](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types#limit_notices)). Your program should also ignore these messages.
# 
# *Hint:* [Catch the ValueError](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11294535/verify-if-a-string-is-json-in-python)
# 
# 
# (1) Parse raw JSON tweets to obtain valid JSON objects. From all valid tweets, construct a pair RDD of `(user_id, text)`, where `user_id` is the `id_str` data field of the `user` dictionary (read [Tweets](#Tweets) section above), `text` is the `text` data field.

# In[4]:

import ujson

def safe_parse(raw_json):
    # your code here
    try:        
        json_data = ujson.loads(raw_json)
        if "text" in json_data and "user" in json_data:
            return json_data
    except ValueError, e:
        return None
    return None

# your code here
pair_RDD = data_RDD.map(safe_parse)                     .filter(lambda x: x != None)                     .map(lambda x: (x['user']['id_str'],x['text'].encode('utf-8')))                     .cache()


# (2) Count the number of different users in all valid tweets (hint: [the `distinct()` method](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#transformations)).
# 
# It should print
# ```
# The number of unique users is: 2083
# ```

# In[6]:

def print_users_count(count):
    print 'The number of unique users is:', count


# In[7]:

# your code here
distinct_pair_RDD = pair_RDD.keys().distinct()
print_users_count(distinct_pair_RDD.count())


# # Part 2: Number of posts from each user partition

# Load the Pickle file `../Data/users-partition.pickle`, you will get a dictionary which represents a partition over 452,743 Twitter users, `{user_id: partition_id}`. The users are partitioned into 7 groups. For example, if the dictionary is loaded into a variable named `partition`, the partition ID of the user `59458445` is `partition["59458445"]`. These users are partitioned into 7 groups. The partition ID is an integer between 0-6.
# 
# Note that the user partition we provide doesn't cover all users appear in the input data.

# (1) Load the pickle file.

# In[8]:

# your code here
import pickle
pickle_file = pickle.load(open('../Data/users-partition.pickle'))


# (2) Count the number of posts from each user partition
# 
# Count the number of posts from group 0, 1, ..., 6, plus the number of posts from users who are not in any partition. Assign users who are not in any partition to the group 7.
# 
# Put the results of this step into a pair RDD `(group_id, count)` that is sorted by key.

# In[9]:

# your code here
def inGroup(user_id):
    if user_id in pickle_file:
        return pickle_file[user_id]
    else:
        return 7


# In[10]:

# your code here
count_tweets_pair_RDD = pair_RDD.map(lambda x: (inGroup(x[0]),1)).partitionBy(8).glom().map(lambda x:(x[0][0],len(x)))

# (3) Print the post count using the `print_post_count` function we provided.
# 
# It should print
# 
# ```
# Group 0 posted 81 tweets
# Group 1 posted 199 tweets
# Group 2 posted 45 tweets
# Group 3 posted 313 tweets
# Group 4 posted 86 tweets
# Group 5 posted 221 tweets
# Group 6 posted 400 tweets
# Group 7 posted 798 tweets
# ```

# In[11]:

def print_post_count(counts):
    for group_id, count in counts:
        print 'Group %d posted %d tweets' % (group_id, count)


# In[12]:

# your code here
print_post_count(count_tweets_pair_RDD.collect())


# # Part 3:  Tokens that are relatively popular in each user partition

# In this step, we are going to find tokens that are relatively popular in each user partition.
# 
# We define the number of mentions of a token $t$ in a specific user partition $k$ as the number of users from the user partition $k$ that ever mentioned the token $t$ in their tweets. Note that even if some users might mention a token $t$ multiple times or in multiple tweets, a user will contribute at most 1 to the counter of the token $t$.
# 
# Please make sure that the number of mentions of a token is equal to the number of users who mentioned this token but NOT the number of tweets that mentioned this token.
# 
# Let $N_t^k$ be the number of mentions of the token $t$ in the user partition $k$. Let $N_t^{all} = \sum_{i=0}^7 N_t^{i}$ be the number of total mentions of the token $t$.
# 
# We define the relative popularity of a token $t$ in a user partition $k$ as the log ratio between $N_t^k$ and $N_t^{all}$, i.e. 
# 
# \begin{equation}
# p_t^k = \log \frac{C_t^k}{C_t^{all}}.
# \end{equation}
# 
# 
# You can compute the relative popularity by calling the function `get_rel_popularity`.

"""
This code implements a basic, Twitter-aware tokenizer.

A tokenizer is a function that splits a string of text into words. In
Python terms, we map string and unicode objects into lists of unicode
objects.

There is not a single right way to do tokenizing. The best method
depends on the application.  This tokenizer is designed to be flexible
and this easy to adapt to new domains and tasks.  The basic logic is
this:

1. The tuple regex_strings defines a list of regular expression
   strings.

2. The regex_strings strings are put, in order, into a compiled
   regular expression object called word_re.

3. The tokenization is done by word_re.findall(s), where s is the
   user-supplied string, inside the tokenize() method of the class
   Tokenizer.

4. When instantiating Tokenizer objects, there is a single option:
   preserve_case.  By default, it is set to True. If it is set to
   False, then the tokenizer will downcase everything except for
   emoticons.

The __main__ method illustrates by tokenizing a few examples.

I've also included a Tokenizer method tokenize_random_tweet(). If the
twitter library is installed (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
and Twitter is cooperating, then it should tokenize a random
English-language tweet.
